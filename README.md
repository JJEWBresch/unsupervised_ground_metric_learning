# unsupervised_ground_metric_learning

This repository includes the numerical code for the experiments of the paper (Unsupervised Ground Metric Learning--Auffenberg, Bresch, Melnyk, Steidl, 2025).
The results are based on an unsupervised approach for OT metric learning proposed by Huizing, Cantini and Peyré (2022).
It includes:
    - Wasserstein Eigenvaector computations, using normalization schemes
    - and Gauß-Seidl schemes,
    - Sinkhorn Eigenvector computations, using normalization schemes
    - and Gauß-Seidl schemes,
    - Mahalanobis-like distances (mainly focusing on normalization schemes),
    - and graph Laplacian based distances (mainly focusing on normalization schemes).

For the synthetic dataset (inspired by Huizing, Cantini and Peyré), the Jupyter Notebook is provided.
